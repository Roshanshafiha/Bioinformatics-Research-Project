# Bioinformatics Research Collaborators Network

# PROJECT: BRCA2 R-loops
Task Accomplished: 

* Extract the repetitive elements in WT BRCA2 and WT PAF1 samples.
* conduct differential repetitive element expression analysis on these samples.
* Differential repetitive element expression analysis - Mutant BRCA2 vs WT BRCA2
* Differential repetitive element expression analysis - Mutant BRCA2 vs WT WT PAF1.
* Analyze the differentially expressed repetitive elements in enricher and observe if they are found in any other cancer related studies.
* Create a HTML file and submit the findings and interpretations to the project leader.
